We included 12 variables that were available across all three studies
and captured information about the participant's interactions, as well
as cognitive-, emotional-, and motivational self in relationship with
the majority group. We chose these two aspects in particular because (1)
the interaction-specific information exemplified the structural
missingness issue of modern ESM data and (2) the motivational,
emotional, and cognitive experience offered a diverse conceptualization
of migration experience (beyond behavioral measurements) that is
becoming more common in the literature \citep[][]{Kreienkamp2022d}. Full
methodological details are available in Online Supplemental Material A,
but basic item information, descriptives, and correlations are also
available in \tblref{tab:descrLong}.
