% Abstract
\abstract{
Psychological time series data has not only become more common but also more diverse and complex. Researchers and practitioners are increasingly interested in non-stationary developmental patterns of multivariate concepts, across different time scales, while contextualized measurements bring about issues of non-imputable missingness. At the same time, clustering analyses offer the potential of reducing these complexities to important and meaningful patterns. Such procedures aid researchers and practitioners in describing and exploring patterns across participants and can promote the creation of more embedded theories and interventions. In this manuscript, we propose feature-based time series clustering as a flexible, transparent, and well-grounded clustering approach that addresses the growing challenges of dimensionality, missingness, and time scales. We introduce the individual feature extraction, -reduction, and -clustering steps and illustrate their utility with an empirical example. We show that time series features such as means, autocorrelations, and linear trends are not only familiar to psychological researchers but are also conceptually meaningful in interpreting time series clusters. Beyond the conceptual and methodological introduction, we also provide practical algorithm overviews and readily available code for data preparation, analysis, and interpretation.

Recent years have seen a striking increase in the number and variety of research studies that follow participants' everyday experiences and collect real-world psychological time series \citep[e.g.,][; also see \fgrref{fig:ScopusEsm}]{hamaker2017}\footnote{In psychology, extensive longitudinal data collection methods are often referred to as experience sampling method (ESM), ecological momentary assessment (EMA), or ambulatory assessment (AA) studies. While the terms come for different conceptual backgrounds, they share a focus on collecting data over an extended period of time to capture people's behaviors and experiences as they vary over time and in response to different situations and events. In this article, we will use the experience sampling (ESM) term as it has the strongest footing within the clustering literature.}. These extensive longitudinal data sets come with new forms of heterogeneity, where researchers have to consider differences across large numbers of participants, time points, and variables \citep[e.g.,][]{cattell1966, Monden2015, wardenaar2013}. Oftentimes, however, researchers are interested in precisely this complexity and wish to understand how people differ in their temporal developments across several variables \citep[e.g.,][]{ernst2021}. One relatively recent addition to the toolbox of ESM researchers has been time series clustering --- the idea of inductively grouping participants based on the similarity of their time series \citep{ariens2020}.

Time series clustering has a number of conceptual use cases with psychological data. Prime among them is the ability to reduce the time, variable, and person complexity by extracting participant-level structures. These reduction and structuring qualities can be essential in detecting phenomena and extracting more abstract functional principles \citep[][]{eronen2021a}. These phenomena and principles can be meaningful differences that distinguish participants in different clusters, as well important patterns, trends, and relationships that participants share within a cluster \citep[e.g.,][]{schrodt2000}. Once distinct groups and patterns have been identified, researchers can examine the extent to which these within-group and between-group structures are associated with other variables of interest, such as personality traits, demographic characteristics, or other psychological constructs \citep[e.g.,][]{monden2022}. Once meaningful and robust structures and patterns are detected, time series clustering can, thus, be used to inform the development of robust theories as well as targeted interventions and therapies for individuals, for example, with mood disorders and other psychological conditions \citep[e.g.,][]{borsboom2021, eronen2020}.


%Time-series clustering has been extremely common in other empirical fields, including analyses of astronomical, meteorological, and aviation pathways, biological and medical developments, as well as energy and finance patterns \citep{Aghabozorgi2015}. But also for psychological data, time-series clustering has recently become more common \citep[e.g.,][]{ernst2021}.

The main aim of time series clustering is to inductively group participants in such a way that the dynamics of some variable(s) have maximum similarity for individuals in the same group, and minimum similarity for individuals in different groups \citep[e.g.,][]{Aghabozorgi2015}. In practice, this means time series clustering critically depends on identifying similarities or dissimilarities in time series and then accurately distinguishing different groups \citep[e.g.,][]{Aghabozorgi2015}. Broadly speaking, time series (dis-)similarity can be approximated by either comparing the raw time series or by comparing some numerical representation of the time series (e.g., \citealp[]{liao2005}; see \fgrref{fig:tsClustTax} for an illustration). The (dis-)similarity measurements can then be clustered either on their own or as part of the representation estimation (e.g., \citealp[]{denteuling2021}; see `embedded' in \fgrref{fig:tsClustTax}).

\begin{figure}[!hbtp] %hbtp

  \caption*{Note: \\

As such, the taxonomy and the notes are neither exhaustive nor complete in distinguishing different approaches. Additionally, terms and labels are used inconsistently across different types of literature and are chosen to avoid overlapping labels.}
\end{figure}

Thus far, one of the most common clustering approaches for ESM data has been to group individuals based on person-specific model parameters --- notably intercepts and slopes from vector autoregression models \citep[VAR; e.g.,][]{ariens2020}. While these model parameters are familiar to researchers in the field, the model-based approach has a number of important shortcomings. Computationally, the number of parameters compounds with increases in variables and lag orders, which tends to result in efficiency and accuracy reduction for most clustering algorithms and is sometimes referred to as the dimensionality curse \citep{altman2018}\footnote{As an illustration of this scalability issue, consider a VAR model of 8 variables that includes the first three lags (i.e., VAR(3)). For each of the 8 variables, we would have 25 parameters --- one intercept and 24 slopes (8 variables * 3 lags each). That compounds to a total of 200 parameters per person (8 variables * 25 parameters).}. But more importantly, using model parameters means that the clustering is restricted by the assumptions and limitations of the statistical model. To take the common VAR model as an example, the model assumes that the time intervals between measurements are identical (i.e., equidistant measurements), it does not allow for missing values, and it assumes that the means as well as variances of the variables do not change over time \citep[i.e., stationarity assumption;][]{lutkepohl2005}. 

These shortcomings, however, stand in sharp contrast with the types of data researchers commonly collect and common research interests in the field. Psychological researchers might, for example, collect data based on the occurrence of natural events, which tends to result in non-equidistant measurements \citep[e.g.,][]{myin-germeys2018, hamaker2017} and context-specific missingness that cannot be imputed, for instance, interaction quality perceptions \citep[e.g.,][]{kivela2022, lavori2008}. At the same time, researchers are often specifically interested in non-stationary developments, looking, for example, at how symptom levels and -variations change over time --- often abruptly and non-linearly \citep[][]{bringmann2018b, helmich2020a}. We offer a more extensive discussion of the current challenges that clustering approaches should address in \appref{app:ChallengesAppendix}. In short, the time series clustering repertoire should be extended to approaches that can more flexibly allow for diverse measurement and missingness patterns and can capture non-stationary data, including non-linear trends, also across different time scales.

Importantly, model-based clustering is not the only clustering approach, and model intercepts and slopes are not the only way in which researchers conceptualize and describe time series. A flexible extension of model-based clustering is feature-based clustering \citep[e.g.,][]{Aghabozorgi2015}\footnote{It should be noted that a third option is shape-based clustering, which uses the raw time series and seeks to match different time series by non-linearly stretching and contracting the time axes. Shape-based clustering might be less relevant to many psychological time series because the forced alignment and scaling can, for example, lead to misspecifications \citep[e.g., ][]{faloutsos1994}. Such scaling issues are less of a concern for highly regular and comparable time series such as EEG \citep[][]{huang1985}.}. Whereas model-based clustering is specifically limited to model parameters as time series characteristics, feature-based clustering extends the time series characteristics to virtually any numerical summary of a time series \citep[e.g.,][]{liao2005}. As an illustration of the flexibility of this approach, a commonly used software package for this approach allows users to extract a total of 794 time series features \citep[][]{christ2018}. Time series features can be chosen by the user based on their research question and can, for example, include the mean and standard deviation of a time series, but also linear and non-linear trends, inertia-related features such as auto-correlations, or the stability of the time series \citep[e.g., mean absolute change; e.g.,][]{barandas2020}. Given the flexibility of the feature-based approach, users are able to apply the analysis across multivariate data, feature extraction mitigates issues of non-equidistant and structurally missing data, and the features can capture and compare across non-linear trends at different time scales.

\section{Feature-based Time Series Clustering}

\subsection{Features of Psychological Time Series}
There are hundreds of possible ts features 

\citet{kuppens2017} originally proposed (1) variability, (2) co-variance or ICC, (3) inertia, and (4) cross-lagged correlations. These features were then extended and formalized by \citet{krone2018} into (1) within-person variance, (2) innovation, (3) inertia or autocorrelation, (4) cross-lagged regression parameters, (5) covariances as granularity, and (6) mean intensity. \citet{krone2018} were even able to use these features to cluster study participants.

\citet{dejonckheere2019} discuss (1) mean, (2) variance, (3) relative variance, (4) instability, (5) inertia / autoregression, (6) interdependence / network density, (7) granularity or differentiation / ICC, (8) correlation, and (9) diversity / Gini coefficient. 

Outside the psychological literature, time series features have also included more summaries in terms of measurement distribution, categorical states, and, importantly, nonlinear developments. 

\citet{kiwuwa-muyingo2011} proposed to extract clinically meaningful states for medical adherence data. 

\citet{wang2006} propose a set of nine statistical features for describing a trajectory: (1) trend, (2) seasonality, (3) periodicity, (4) skewness, (5) kurtosis, (6) serial correlation, (7) non-linearity, (8) self-similarity, and (9) chaos. This selection was also used by \citep{fulcher2013}. \citet{adya2001} proposed a total of 28 features relevant for forecasting, which largely fit within the selection proposed by \citet{wang2006}.


Fortunately, past conceptual and empirical efforts offer valuable discussions of common time series features in psychological research. While the final selection of features should always be driven by the research questions and field-specific conventions, we can build a practical toolbox of meaningful time series features for psychological data. In particular, we propose to focus on six features based on common psychological research questions and recent works on affect dynamics \citep[e.g.,][]{dejonckheere2019, kuppens2017, adya2001}. An overview of the proposed features, their substantive interpretations, and mathematical operationalizations is available in \tblref{tab:esmFeatures}.

The first two features are a person's \textit{central tendency} and \textit{variability}. Familiar statistics from probability theory, the two features sit at the heart of many fundamental psychological questions. ``Are some people happier than others?'' (i.e., difference in central tendency), and "Are people settled in their attitudes towards migrants or do they fluctuate over time?'' (i.e., difference in variability). Mathematically, both features have parametric and robust options to choose from (e.g., parametric: mean and standard deviation; robust: median and median absolute deviation). 

The third and fourth features describe the structure of the variability within the time series. In particular, \textit{(in)stability} captures the average change between two consecutive measurements. Do changes tend to be slow and gradual or fast and abrupt? Mathematically, (in)stability measurements often look at the average change between two consecutive measurements. \textit{Inertia} describes how much a measurement carries over to future measurements. There are two main ways in which experiences tend to be connected to future experiences --- resistance to change and seasonality. Both forms of inertia relate to different types of research questions. ``Do patients stay in a depressed mood for several measurements?'' (i.e., stability-inertia), and ``Do participants drink more alcohol on Fridays?'' (i.e., periodicity-inertia). Both forms of inertia are often measured using autocorrelations with either a lag-1 (stability-inertia) or the lag of the seasonality (e.g., seven days). Periodicity-inertia can additionally be captured using wave patterns (e.g., fourier or wavelet transformation).

The final two features are linear and nonlinear trends. \textit{Linear trends} are a common research interest for longitudinal data. ``Do patient symptoms improve?'' or ``Does worker productivity decline?'', are familiar types of research questions. Mathematically, such linear trends are commonly captured using (piecewise) linear regression coefficients. \textit{Nonlinear trends} are important in two regards. Firstly, nonlinearity is a deviation from linear trends and secondly, the shape and structure of the nonlinear trend. Questions like ``Is the development of anxiety a nonlinear process?'' are mathematically captured using nonlinearity parameters such the bicoherence metrics \citep{cuddy2009}. The structure of nonlinear trends is often mathematically captured using polynomial coefficients or more broadly by how wiggly the line is (e.g., estimated degrees of freedom of GAM spline models; similar to the number of spikes \citealp[]{caro-martin2018}). 

This selection of the proposed six time-series features is in no way exhaustive or imperative. Both using a purely data-driven approach or selecting other aspects to summarize the time series are legitimate options. The list seeks to offer a practical toolbox of features that are common and meaningful to psychological research questions and -practice (see \tblref{tab:esmFeatures} for a more complete overview).

The feature-based clustering can be structured into four main steps \citep{rasanen2009, wang2006}. (1) The selection and preparation of the input variables, (2) the extraction of the features that describe the time series, (3) an optional feature reduction step if there are too many data points for the clustering algorithms, and (4) the actual clustering of the time series features. We provide a conceptual overview that can be used alongside this section in \fgrref{fig:TSCFlow}.

\paragraph{Input variables}
Time series clustering starts with the selection and preparation of the variables of interest. While the selection will necessarily be field- and concept-specific, there are a few conceptual and methodological issues that should be considered. Conceptually, the included variables should adequately capture the concept of interest and should be meaningful to the understanding of the time series. There are, for example, calls that emotion dynamics should be assessed with a repertoire of positive and negative emotions \citep[e.g.,][]{dejonckheere2019}, migration experiences are fully captured with affect, behavior, cognition, and desire measurements \citep[e.g.,][]{Kreienkamp2022d}, and many health developments are commonly captured within the biopsychosocial domains \citep[e.g.,][]{suls2004}. At the same time, however, the added number of variables can become a methodological concern. Not only can redundant and irrelevant variables diminish the quality of the analyses, but with intensive longitudinal data the number of data points compounds across participants, measurement occasions, and variables so that additional variables can make many of the following steps substantially more difficult (also see \fgrref{fig:TSCFlowN}).

Once the important variables have been selected, the data needs to be prepared for the analysis steps. Importantly, this not only means validating and cleaning the data (e.g., re-coding, removing duplicate or unwanted measurements) but also making the time series comparable. Two important steps are making the time-frames and response scales comparable across participants. Extracting features that describe the development of a month for one participant but 90 days for another participant might not be comparable for some psychological phenomena. This comparability is important on a conceptual level but the difference in data availability might also influence the clustering steps, where the participant with the shorter measurement period would, for example, have a larger number of missing values. It is thus generally advised to reduce the data to a common and comparable time frame. 

\paragraph{Feature extraction}
The main aim of feature extraction is to describe the most important and meaningful aspects of a time series. There are, however, hundreds of possible features to describe psychological time series \citep[e.g., tsfresh][]{christ2018}. One approach to choosing relevant features would be to extract a large number of features and then assess which features are most effective at capturing differences in the time series. However, such an approach is not always advisable for psychological time series. For one, features should reduce the data dimensionality --- it would thus not necessarily be advisable to describe 60 ESM measurements with 180 time series features. More importantly, however, careful feature extraction can be crucial in the interpretability and explainability of the results. This is particularly the case when features have a conceptual or psychological meaning. Taking the concept of well-being as an example, psychologists might be interested in whether certain participants tend to have higher well-being in general (i.e., mean) or whether some participants fluctuate between extremely high and low well-being (i.e., variance). But psychologists might not necessarily be interested in the exact time point after which 50\% of the summed well-being values lie (i.e., relative mass quantile index) or how much different sine wave patterns within the well-being data correlate with one another (i.e., cross power spectral density). We would, thus, strongly advocate for a careful selection of time series features that are meaningful to the field and concepts.

\paragraph{Feature reduction}
Once a meaningful selection of time series features has been extracted for each variable and participant, the total number of data points usually remains too large for most clustering algorithms. As an example, a relatively common scenario would include 10 variables of interest, where 8 time series features are extracted, resulting in 80 features per participant (with a common sample size of 100 participants that would result in a total of 8,000 data points in this hypothetical example). We offer an illustration of the compounding numbers of data points in \fgrref{fig:TSCFlowN}. The difficulty of working with such a large number of dimensions is sometimes termed the `dimensionality curse' \citep[e.g.,][]{altman2018}. To deal with this dimensionality issue, two main approaches have been proposed --- feature selection and feature projection (a full overview of the approaches, methods, and common algorithms is available in \tblref{tab:featureReduction}). 

Feature selections seek to create a subset of the most important features. The many available approaches differ in how they seek to determine the importance of the individual features. Generally speaking, selection methods can be categorized as `filter', `wrapper', or `hybrid' methods. The filter methods, broadly speaking determine important features by identifying irrelevant features (e.g., because features do not capture much information), and identifying redundant features (e.g., because features capture the same information). Wrapper methods on the other hand avoid the feature-based evaluation and focus on the performance of the later model to identify the most important features. A wrapper, thus, compares the performance of models with different feature combinations. Traditional examples of wrappers are forward selection or backward elimination procedures. Because filter methods might not always perform well and wrapper methods are computationally intensive\footnote{Computationally \textit{k} features could be considered in \(2^k – 1\) possible combinations --- for the example of 80 features that would allow for \(1.20 \times 10^{24}\) (over one septillion) combinations.}, hybrid methods seek to combine the two methods and find a balance between computational effort (i.e., efficiency) and performance (i.e., effectiveness). Methods might, for example, use a filter step to reduce the size of features considered in a later wrapper step.

The second general approach to the dimensionality curse has been feature projection. Projection methods are relatively common in psychological research --- including, factor- and principal component analyses. Generally speaking, projection methods seek to transform the many features in such a way that a much smaller number of new variables can accurately capture the variance and structure of the original features (i.e., the data is projected to a lower dimensional space). Commonly, this is achieved using linear transformations (e.g., principal component analysis), or more complex nonlinear transformations (e.g., t-SNE). Generally speaking, feature selection procedures have the benefit that they retain the interpretable feature labels directly and immediately indicate which features were most informative in the sample. Feature projection methods, on the other hand, tend to be more generalized and are more readily available.

\paragraph{Feature clustering}
For feature-based time-series clustering, the main aim is to organize participants into groups so that the features of participants within a group are as similar as possible, while the features of people in different groups are as different as possible. The crux of clustering is, thus, to have clearly defined and effective measurements of (dis)similarity. Most of the clustering algorithms used today use some form of distance measurement to optimize group assignment (or similarity measurement for qualitative features). While others have produced excellent overviews of the many clustering approaches available \citep[e.g.,][]{xu2015}, we will briefly introduce some of the more readily available approaches suitable for most time series feature data. The well-established and readily available clustering approaches can, broadly speaking, be categorized as based on (1) centroids, (2) distributions, (3) density, (4) hierarchies, or (5) a combination thereof (see \tblref{tab:clusterApproaches}). 

Each of these approaches can be a valuable clustering approach for time series feature data and users will usually have to make an informed decision based on the structure of their data as well as an appropriate weighing of accuracy and efficiency. As an example, under ideal conditions, all approaches are likely to suggest very similar clusters. However, when the shapes of clusters, for example, become more complex in a multi-dimensional space, density-based or hierarchy-based approaches that allow for more bottom-up clustering are likely to be more accurate. Yet, with higher numbers of participants and features, both density- and hierarchy-based approaches may perform less well and the more efficient centroid-based methods might be more effective. Similarly, several of the proposed time series features are statics that are generated from Gaussian distributions and a distribution-based algorithm might be ideally suited to separate such distributions \hl{(Corduas \& Piccollo, 2008)}. Yet, in cases where mis-specifications are costly, a method with fewer assumptions might be more advisable. 

There is thus, unfortunately, no one-size-fits-all solution to clustering. On the bright side, however, the thriving methodological developments in the clustering literature offer a wide variety of options that offer prospects even for extremely large and complex data sets. We provide a short intuitive explanation for common approaches, together with some of their characteristics and example algorithms in \tblref{tab:clusterApproaches}. For our own illustration, we have chosen that centroid-based k-means clustering. While k-means comes at the expense of high accuracy with more complex cluster shapes, we specifically chose k-means because it is an extremely efficient method that works well with large participant- and feature numbers without making too many restrictive assumptions about the shape of the data. K-means is also well-established within the research community and has been readily implemented in many statistical software packages. Additionally, many of the feature selection methods have specifically been designed for the well-established k-means algorithm. As such, the k-means offers a good starting point for many psychological researchers and the method should be generalizable across a relatively wide variety of projects.

\section{Empirical Illustration}
To illustrate common use cases of feature-based time series clustering with psychological ESM data, we apply the clustering process to a recent set of studies that collected diverse concepts with context-specific measurements. The illustration specifically uses data from research on migration experiences, where researchers have started using ESM data to follow the daily interactions of migrants with the cultural majority groups \citep[e.g.,][]{Keil2020}. This new type of research comes as a response to prominent reviews, which have called for more longitudinal \citep[e.g.,][]{Ward2019} and real-world data \citep[e.g.,][]{McKeown2017}. At the same time, conceptual works have pushed for more diverse assessments of migration experiences, including motivational, affective, cognitive, and behavioral aspects \citep[e.g.,][]{Kreienkamp2022d}. The migration ESM research, thus, offers a good example of the modern ESM data that introduces diverse conceptualizations and more event-specific missingness patterns.

\section{Discussion}
% aims re-iterated
We sought to introduce a flexible and transparent analysis that aids researchers in describing, exploring, and understanding psychological time series data. Such an analysis needs to address the demands of the growing variety of ESM research. In particular, modern describe- and explore analyses should be able to deal with high dimensionality, structural missingness, and diverse time-varying developments. We have argued that feature-based time series clustering is one option that meets this challenge. 

We have methodologically deconstructed the feature extraction, feature reduction and feature clustering steps and offered methodological as well as conceptual examples for each step. Within this step-wise approach, our article shows that feature-based clustering offers an excellent fit for psychological research practice as both the features as well as the analysis steps are well-established within the field and statistical packages are readily available. Time series features (such as means or linear trends) are not only easy to extract but also hold conceptual meaning for psychological data and can be chosen to address specific research questions (also see \tblref{tab:esmFeatures}). 

To illustrate the practical utility of the approach, we applied the method to real-life empirical data with diverse conceptualizations, missingness, and nonlinear trends. We make available the full code, custom functions, and illustrations to aid the approachability of the method. In the interpretation step we also show how the clusters can be compared across the original feature set as well as other meaningful situational and person-specific differences (e.g., see \fgrref{fig:clusterFeatVar}). We also find that for our example of migration experiences, the method was useful in discerning adaptive from more stressful experiences and helped to contextualize the diverging experiences.

As with any statistical method, feature-based time series clustering is not without limitations. 
In particular, feature-based clustering has both a usability as well as robustness limitation in its multiple steps. In terms of convenience, each of the three steps requires users to make an informed decision about the choice of method and algorithm. These additional steps of decision-making and transparency heighten the initial barrier to entry. We hope that our empirical illustration offers a relatively generalizable procedure that showcases the ease of use but clustering unfortunately does not offer a universal one-size-fits-all solution. 

In terms of methodological robustness, the variety of methods in each of the steps also brings with it the potential uncomparable results across methods. While the variety and diversity of methods is helpful in finding options even for more complex types of data, different algorithms often offer different results. And even when patterns produce robust clustering solutions across algorithms, individual methods might still have their ideosyncratic shortcomings and might, for example, be sensitive to outliers. 

Notwithstanding the limitations, we believe that feature-based clustering offers an exciting new potential for psychological time series. Across a variety of scientific fields, feature-based time series clustering has been valued for its structuring and simplifying utilities. Within the growing field of psychological time series, modern ESM data is becoming increasingly more complex in terms of participants, variables, and time points. Feature-based time series clusters can aid in reducing these complexities to important and meaningful patterns, an increasingly important task for researchers and practitioners.

\section{ESM Data Challenges}
\label{app:ChallengesAppendix}
We will briefly consider which challenges modern ESM data introduce and what qualities are called for in an extension of the clustering repertoire. We particularly highlight issues of dimensionality, non-equidistant or missing measurements, an interest in non-stationary trends, as well as inconsistent/diverse time scales. 

Concerning dimensionality issues, especially more abstract psychological experiences often need a wider variety of measurements to be captured adequately. Today, few clinical conditions are captured with a single symptom measure \citep[e.g.,][]{cramer2016}, emotions are rarely assessed in isolation \citep[e.g.,][]{reitsema2022}, and socio-cultural experiences are now widely considered to be multimodal \citep[e.g.,][]{Kreienkamp2022d}. This also means that modern analysis techniques increasingly need be able to accommodate an increased focus on multivariate developments. At the same time, however, an increase in the number of considered variables tends to come at the expense of computational load for model estimations, and clustering models may not converge \citep[the aforementioned dimensionality curse;][]{altman2018}. A modern time series clustering technique should consequently be able to summarize and structure multivariate phenomena without running into computational load issues.

Another common type of data that are measurement regiments that collect data in irregular time intervals (i.e., non-equidistant measurements). Common are, for example, procedures where participants are asked to respond at random times throughout the day (i.e., signal-contingent) or following specific natural events of interest \citep[i.e., event-contingent; see][]{shiffman2008, myin-germeys2018}. Under such conditions data tends to violate the equidistance assumption that is expected by many time series models \citep[][]{hamaker2017}. Smaller issues of non-equidistant data can be avoided with transformations \citep[e.g., dynamic time warping,][]{berndt1994} or newer modeling procedures \citep[e.g., continuous-time models;][]{dehaan-rietdijk2017} but for many analyses, including some cluster approaches, non-equidistant measurements remain a prevalent issue. 

Structural missingness remains an even more strenuous challenge. Structural missingness occurs when data is missing because it logically cannot be collected \citep[as opposed to probabilistically missing data;][]{little2020, mclean2017}. Often, however, researchers might want to include variables in their models that are not available under all conditions. Follow-up and event-contingent questions are a common example in ESM studies. Researchers, for example, ask about the frequency, intensity, or duration of symptoms --- but only if a symptom was present \citep{kivela2022}. Such approaches become specifically critical in cases of sensitive questions such as questions about suicidal ideation or other potentially trauma-inducing questions \citep[e.g.,][]{glenn2022}. The most common practice for structurally missing data is to either exclude the variable or any measurement that has no structurally missing data \citep[e.g.,][]{lavori2008}\footnote{This is the case because the most commonly used models require complete data \citep{schafer2002} and structurally missing data cannot be imputed as it logically does not exist \citep[e.g.,][]{lavori2008}.} --- neither option suits a research question that wishes to include variables with common structural missingness, such as event-specific or follow-up questions. In short, new clustering approaches should be able to deal with structurally missing data in order to address modern ESM data.

When it comes to studying developmental trajectories, psychological researchers are often also interested in nonstationary processes because they are more representative of the complex, dynamic behavior of the human mind. In psychology, nonstationary processes are typically used to study phenomena such as cognitive development \citep[][]{quartz1997}, decision-making \citep[][]{ratcliff2016}, and emotion dynamics \citep[][]{bringmann2018b}. These processes are often characterized by changes in the underlying statistical properties of the data over time, such as changes in the mean or variance \citep[][]{molenaar2009}. Especially when considering changes in mean levels, researchers are often interested in nonlinear changes because they describe human functioning better. For example, in decision making people might switch between choices \citep[][]{ratcliff2016}, or patients reducing medication might experience mood swings \citep[][]{helmich2020a}. Similarly, psychologists are often also interested in how variances change over time. This is especially the case because several changes in an individual's variance have been found to be indicative of critical changes, including depression relapses and symptom shifts more generally \citep[e.g.,][]{schreuder2020, wichers2020}. There is, thus, also a need for time series clustering algorithms that capture nonstationary processes, including nonlinear trends.

Psychological time series often exhibit complex patterns and relationships that can change over different time scales. For example, a time series of daily mood ratings may show a weekly pattern, with higher ratings on the weekends and lower ratings during the week. At the same time, the series may also exhibit a longer-term trend, with overall mood levels increasing or decreasing over the course of several months or years \citep[e.g.,][]{Ram2014}. \sout{These different time scales can be studied separately or in combination, using different statistical techniques and modeling approaches \citep[][]{bertenthal2007, jeronimus2019a}.} Different time scales can become an even more difficult issue when different variables in a model develop on different time scales \citep{bringmann2022b}. Different time scales are thus also a concern clustering approaches should be able to address.
