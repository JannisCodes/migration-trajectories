\subsection{Data}

We used a data set following migration experiences collected by
\citet[][]{Kreienkamp2022b}. The data set consists of three studies that
followed migrants who had recently arrived in the Netherlands in their
daily interactions with the Dutch majority group members. After a
general migration-focused pre-questionnaire, participants were invited
twice per day to report on their (potential) interactions with majority
group members for at least 30 days. The short ESM surveys were sent out
at around lunch (12pm) and dinner time (7pm). After the 30 day study
period participants filled in a post-questionnaire that mirrored the
pre-questionnaire. Participants received either monetary compensation or
partial course credits based on the number of surveys they completed.
For our empirical example we focus on the variables that were collected
during the ESM surveys and were available in all three studies. Full
methodological details are available in the empirical article by
\citet[][]{Kreienkamp2022b}.

\subsubsection{Sample}

The original studies included 207 participants (\(N_{S1}=\) 23,
\(N_{S2}=\) 113, \(N_{S3}=\) 71) with a total of 10,297 measurements.
The studies differed substantially in the maximum length of
participation (\$N\_\{t:S1\}=\$63, \(N_{t:S2}=\) 69, \(N_{t:S3}=\) 155).

feature engineering: feature extraction + feature selection

use domain knowledge to extract new variables from raw data (summarize)

\textit{k} features means \(2^k â€“ 1\) possible models

maximize relevance and minimize redundancy
