Welcome to the GitHub Repository for the 'Migration Trajectories' Project. This repository accompanies the publication "_A Gentle Introduction and Application of Feature-Based Clustering with Psychological Time Series_" in [Multivariate Behavioral Research](https://doi.org/10.1080/00273171.2024.2432918).

This repository brings together the full manuscript (synchronized from Overleaf) as well as all data sets and their analysis markdown files (syncronized from a local RStudio instance in RMarkdown files).

The full annotated analysis code is available as part of our [Illustration Tutorial](https://janniscodes.github.io/ts-feature-clustering-illustration/).

Please note that the full repository will remain 'private' and anonymized until after the manuscript has been accepted for publication (to allow for blind peer review).
